Source of the Color Computer 3 game Shanghai

This repository contains the contents of seven floppy disks, identified by the writing on their labels:

* BKUP0516	Backup disk

* SRCEMERGENCY	Backup disk
* BKUP0624	Backup disk
* COMPDATA	Utilities to verify the victory screen would fit in ROM
* COMPRESS	Utilities to compress the victory screen
* TITLSCRN	Utilities to compress the title screen

SRCEMERGENCY is so labelled because I used it to back up a disk that went bad on me.  It appears to have game source later
than 5/31/87 but earler than 6/24/87
